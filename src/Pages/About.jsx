                    Hello! I'm Son, a passionate freelance photographer with a love for capturing emotion, light, and storytelling through the lens. 
                    Whether it's serene landscapes, candid portraits, or styled editorial shots â€” I aim to freeze time and create timeless visual experiences.
                </p>
                <p className='text-Section-2'>
                    With a deep appreciation for natural light and minimal aesthetics, my work reflects a clean yet expressive style.
                    I'm always inspired by the little details, the in-between moments, and the beauty found in everyday life. 
                    Let's tell your story through photography.
